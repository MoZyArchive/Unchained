          Roommates Shawn and Eric are lounging around in their
          apartment on a bright and sunny summer's day. Eric is
          sitting on the couch, watching Maury and eating cereal,
          while Shawn browses the internet at the dining table,
          giggling occasionally.

                              SHAWN
                    Hey, Eric. Listen to this one.

          He leans in closer to the screen, which shows a forum with a
          Troll Face logo. The camera catches a glimpse of the
          original poster's name as Shawn reads the post - "Troll
          Prince".

                              SHAWN
                    "This is really freaky! It totally
                    works! Katie Gallner from Houston,
                    Texas did it and her high school
                    sweetheart proposed the very next
                    day. They have been married for two
                    years!

                              ERIC
                         (not really paying attention,
                         still spooning cereal into his
                         mouth)
                    Really?

                              SHAWN
                    Brian Kurtz from Portland, Oregon
                    did it and the day after he met a
                    cute bartender who kissed him on a
                    dare. They got married six months
                    later.

                              ERIC
                         (chewing)
                    Mm-hmm.

                              SHAWN
                    Susan Leibowitz did it and went on
                    the best date of her life with her
                    brother's best friend the day
                    after. They've been together six
                    years! Send this letter to 20
                    people and the love of your life
                    will kiss you tomorrow at 12
                    o'clock!

                              ERIC
                    You're such a weirdo, Shawn. You
                    know that?

                              SHAWN
                         (ignoring Eric's comment)
                    If you don't, you'll have bad luck
                    for seven years.

          Eric turns around and gives Shawn a slightly worried look.
          Shawn goes into his email and selects his twenty victims,
          cackling as he scrolls down his list of contacts.Â 

                              ERIC
                    Can I ask you something? (He
                    continues without waiting for a
                    reply.) Why do you even bother with
                    that crap? You know none of it
                    actually works, right?

          SHAWN'S DREAM SEQUENCE
          CLOSE UP: shawn's chain letter email at the top of someone's
          inbox.

          A beautiful girl about Shawn's age is primping herself up in
          her room and is notified by her laptop that she has new
          mail. She leans in to her laptop screen to check it out and
          then bursts into tears.

                              MARIANA
                         (sobbing)
                    Shawnie! I'm sorry! Please take me
                    back!

          She continues sobbing while clutching a taped-back-together
          picture of herself and Shawn. Mascara runs down her face as
          she runs to the kitchen and begins stuffing her face with
          ice cream.
          CLOSE UP: shawn's chain letter email at the top of someone
          else's inbox.

          A slightly older guy, wearing a sweat-stained, short-sleeved
          button down, is sitting in his dingy studio apartment. His
          eyes widen and he looks down at a piece of paper in his
          hands, which is a list titled "How to Make Shawn's Life a
          Living Hell". He growls and starts "Hulking out", tearing
          the piece of paper to bits with his teeth, knocking his
          chair back, and roaring. He flings himself onto the air
          mattress on the floor in anger. It pops and deflates.

          INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

          Shawn comes back to reality.

                              SHAWN
                    Because it's freaking HILARIOUS.

          He sends the message and leans back to bask in his glory.

                              ERIC
                    Are you sure it's not because you
                    wanna get with Taylor?

          Eric grins and waggles his eyebrows.

                              SHAWN
                         (startled)
                    What? Taylor? No way!

          He fumbles with his words and tries to act nonchalant, but
          it is obvious that he does have feelings for Taylor. Eric
          nods and smiles, unconvinced, and turns back to watch the
          shouting and screaming on TV.

                              ERIC
                    Whatever you say, Shawn.

          INT. APARTMENT HALLWAY - THE NEXT DAY

          Shawn takes out his keys to unlock his door. The door to the
          apartment across from his opens up and he turns around to
          see TAYLOR in the doorway.

                              TAYLOR
                    Hey, Shawn.

                              SHAWN
                         (nervous)
                    Uh, hey. Taylor.

          She half-smiles at his nervousness and leans against her
          doorframe.

                              TAYLOR
                    So apparently on Tuesday our
                    internet is going to be shut off
                    for a few hours starting at like,
                    ten in the morning. The landlord
                    was here a minute ago and just told
                    me to tell you.

                              SHAWN
                    Oh. Uh. Okay.

          He stands there awkwardly under Taylor's watchful gaze for a
          few moments. She is enjoying watching him squirm. Finally,
          she lets him off the hook.

                              TAYLOR
                    Well, I guess I'll see you
                    whenever, Shawn.

          She closes the door to her apartment, locks it, and heads
          down the hallway. Shawn watches her go and lets go of a
          sigh. He turns to go into his apartment.

                              TAYLOR
                         (suddenly flirty and sexy,
                         almost a "bedroom voice")
                    Hey, Shawn!

          Shawn turns around and barely has time to register Taylor
          approaching him until her arms are wrapped around his neck
          and she is kissing him. He looks surprised more than
          anything else. They pull apart, just as Shawn's watch beeps.
          He looks at it. It is 12:00 on the dot. He looks even more
          surprised, and confused, but is enjoying Taylor hanging off
          of him.

                              SHAWN
                         (to Taylor)
                    Can you do that again?

                              TAYLOR
                         (she winks and giggles)
                         (in an uncharacteristically
                         sweet and girly voice)
                    Anything you want, sugar bunny!

          She kisses him again and this time, Shawn takes out his
          phone to take a picture. The camera shutter sounds.

          INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

          Shawn stumbles through the door, love-drunk. If this were a
          Japanese anime, he'd have sparkles floating around him and
          hearts in his eyes. He leans back against the door and
          sighs, then suddenly jumps up and does a little victory
          dance.

                              SHAWN
                    Aw yeah, who is the man? I'm the
                    man! Who's the man? That's right,
                    it's me.

          He swaggers over to his laptop and opens his Facebook, but
          is alerted that he has a new email. He opens it and skims
          through. A few words catch his eye - "send this on", "if you
          have a heart", "your fire station will be set on fire" - but
          he glances at his phone and exits out of the window. After
          connecting his phone to his laptop, he absentmindedly turns
          on the tv before leaving the room.
          CLOSE UP: PIctures of taylor and shawn being uploaded onto
          the laptop.

          A breaking news segment begins playing on the television.

                              TV REPORTER
                         (voice over)
                    This is Channel 15 news with a
                    breaking news report.
          CLOSE UP: the reporter, a handsome, dark-haired, young man
          with gelled hair.

                              TV REPORTER
                    Authorities are at the scene of a
                    terrible arson. Moments ago, fire
                    station 23 burst into flame. It's
                    currently unclear what the cause of
                    the blaze was, but thankfully, no
                    one was hurt, as all the
                    firefighters were at another scene.
                    More on this story at five.
                    

          As he is speaking, an inset of the fire station in flames
          plays behind him. The reporter's eyes have a flicker of fire
          in them, but that quickly disappears.
