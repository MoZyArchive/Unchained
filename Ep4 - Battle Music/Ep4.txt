
          EXT. COMPANY BUILDING - NIGHT

          It is dark when Eric, Taylor and Shawn find themselves in
          front of the nondescript yet strangely eerie Company
          Building. Somewhere off in the distance a clock chimes 9
          o'clock. Shawn looks at the paper in his hand and checks the
          address.

                              SHAWN
                    This is it.

          All three of them look up at the building, imagining what
          could possibly be inside.

                              TAYLOR
                    Wait, Shawn! Do you know what
                    you're doing?

                              SHAWN
                    Not a clue. But I have to do
                    something.

          He smiles at her a little weakly.

                              ERIC
                         (to Shawn)
                    Aw, Shawnie, I knew you cared about
                    me.

          He punches Shawn's shoulder and the three of them enter
          together.

          INT. LOBBY - NIGHT

          The lobby is well-lit, well furnished, and immaculately
          clean. A woman, Linda, sits behind a desk, playing on her
          Gameboy with the volume on max. Taylor approaches her.

                              TAYLOR
                    Um, excuse me, we're looking for...

          She looks back at Shawn, who starts forward and is joined by
          Eric.

                              SHAWN
                    The Troll Prince. We're looking for
                    the Troll Prince.

          The woman pauses her game and looks up at them.

                              LINDA
                    Which one of you is Shawn?

                              SHAWN
                    That'd be me, ma'am.

                              LINDA
                    Eugh. Don't call me ma'am. Go on
                    in. He's expecting you.

          She waves them towards an elevator off to the left side of
          the room.

                              ERIC
                    Is it okay if we go in with him?

                              LINDA
                         (scoffs)
                    He's going to need all the help he
                    can get.

          The trio moves towards the elevator uncertainly. Whatever
          they were expecting, it wasn't this. Shawn pauses as he
          reaches the door, looking back at Linda.

                              SHAWN
                    We just... go in?

          Linda is already back to playing her game and simply waves
          them on.

                              LINDA
                    The elevator knows what floor to go
                    to.

          He looks at Eric and Taylor standing beside him.

                              SHAWN
                    Ready?

                              TAYLOR
                    Bring it on.

                              ERIC
                    Let's do it.

          They enter and the elevator doors close behind them.

          INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT

          Eric, Taylor, and Shawn stand awkwardly next to each other,
          not saying anything. Above them, elevator music trickles
          down, a slow 'Muzak' version of the Nyan Cat song. Taylor
          flips her hair and Shawn coughs. The elevator dings! and the
          doors open, allowing in a bright light.

          INT. OFFICE - NIGHT

          The Troll Prince sits at his desk in his large, white
          office, wearing a perfectly tailored suit, and playing video
          games. Situated in front of him are a computer monitor, a
          laptop, and a TV with an PS3 hooked up to it. They are
          playing Minecraft, WoW, and Call of Duty, respectively, and
          he is somehow managing to cheat at all of them at once. The
          voices of his angry teammates/servermates echo around him,
          hurling abuses, but he revels in his infamy. There is a
          faint click as Linda comes on the intercom.

                              LINDA
                    Sir, he's just entered the first
                    trial.

                              TROLL PRINCE
                    Excellent. Everything is going
                    according to plan.

          He stands up and straightens his jacket, quite pleased with
          himself.

                              LINDA
                    Sir, the Big Bosses are ready.

          He takes a deep breath and smoothes his hair.

                              TROLL PRINCE
                    I'm on my way.

          EXT. VILLAGE - DAY

          The three heroes blink as their eyes adjust to their
          surroundings. They step out of the elevator, which seems to
          have deposited them in the middle of a bustling medieval
          village square. Looking down at themselves, they find they
          are dressed in period-appropriate wear. Shawn is armed with
          a pair of daggers, Eric with a two-handed sword, and Taylor
          with an intricately carved wooden staff. Cheery, countryside
          music plays from somewhere nearby.

                              ERIC
                    Where the hell are we?

          He turns around to find the elevator gone.

                              SHAWN
                         (a little excitedly)
                    Did we just time travel?

          Shawn notices the daggers hanging at his waist and takes
          them out.

                              SHAWN
                    Whoa.

                              TAYLOR
                    Shawn, I don't think you should be
                    playing with those.

                              SHAWN
                    Why not? They're mine. I think.

                              ERIC
                    Whoa.

          He brandishes his broadsword carefully.

                              SHAWN
                    Aw, no fair. How come you get the
                    big one?

                              ERIC
                    Obviously because I'm better than
                    you.

                              SHAWN
                    Oh yeah? Well I bet I could beat
                    you even without a big ugly sword!

                              ERIC
                    I would love to see you try.

                              VILLAGER
                    Heroes! We're so glad you've
                    arrived!

          The 'heroes' in question jump and turn towards the voice
          approaching them. Shawn and Eric back down a little
          reluctantly, but neither puts his weapon away. The villager
          is a tall, but round fellow and looks somewhat familiar, but
          it is hard to tell exactly who is underneath the giant beard
          he is sporting.

                              VILLAGER
                    We were beginning to believe you'd
                    never come. But now that you're
                    here, our village is saved!

                              TAYLOR
                    Saved? From what?

                              VILLAGER
                    Why, the bandits, of course!
                    They've been plaguing us for nearly
                    six months now, preying on
                    travelers and innocent merchants
                    coming to our village! Our trade
                    has all but stopped because no one
                    is willing to risk traveling here!
                    You must defeat the bandits and
                    save our village!

          There is a heroic trumpet blast and Taylor makes a confused
          face.

          Shawn finds himself holding a journal with a note written in
          it: "Defeat the bandits that are plaguing the village."

                              SHAWN
                    What is this?

          He examines the journal, which is labeled "Quests." Eric and
          Taylor also take a look at it.

                              ERIC
                    Wasn't our original quest to meet
                    this Troll Prince guy?

                              TAYLOR
                    Yeah, we don't exactly have a whole
                    lot of time to spend defeating
                    bandits.

                              SHAWN
                    Well, maybe this is a test!

          He hold the quest journal above his head, there is a little
          toodle, and it appears in his inventory.

                              VILLAGER
                    Before you go though, here is a
                    gift from me.

          He hands them three vials full of a red liquid.

                              VILLAGER
                    Use these potions will give you a
                    burst of strength and energy when
                    you find yourself low. I hope you
                    don't actually need to use them.

          Shawn takes them and gives one each to Eric and Taylor.

                              SHAWN
                    Thanks!

                              VILLAGER
                    May the gods protect you!

          The intrepid trio head off towards the edge of town and the
          villager watches them go. He smiles and pats his belt, from
          which hangs and assortment of troll doll heads

          EXT. ROAD - DAY

          As the heroes get farther away from the village, the cheery
          music that has been following them changes and shifts into a
          piece with beautiful, slow strings, quiet, but also a little
          eerie.

                              TAYLOR
                    I don't like the sound of that.

                              SHAWN
                    The sound of what?

                              TAYLOR
                    The music! Didn't you hear it? It
                    just changed, and I don't like it.

          Shawn and Eric cock their heads to listen. Veteran gamers,
          they have been absorbing the music, but not giving it their
          full attention.

                              SHAWN
                    Huh. Didn't even notice.

          They travel down the road for a little bit more before in
          silence, listening to the music around them when, suddenly,
          it swells and there is a sound like glass shattering.

                              TAYLOR
                    Uh oh.

          EXT. FIELD - DAY

          As the music transitions from orchestral and eerie to
          driving and more horn-centered, the trio finds themselves
          facing two bandits, Jessa and Jaime, across a field. Because
          the bandits were the ones who ambushed them, they get the
          first attack. Jessa, wielding a bow and arrow, shoots at
          Shawn, but he is able to dodge it. Jaime, armed with a
          cutlass, slashes at and scores a hit on Eric. The amount of
          damage he takes shows up above his head.

                              JESSA
                         (cackling)
                    Oh ho ho ho! Look what we've found,
                    Jaime. Wittle hewos who think they
                    can defeat us. How adorable.

                              JAIME
                    They'll soon find out they're
                    sorely mistaken!

          The heroes start off somewhat slowly, struggling to figure
          out the attack system and a little surprised at just how
          skilled they are. Eric proves to be quite a devastating
          force with his sword, while Shawn easily dodges most attacks
          sent his way and is able to land most of his attacks, though
          they are not nearly as powerful as Eric's. Taylor, to her
          credit, grasps the concept of magic quickly and is soon
          sending many elemental attacks at their opponents. During
          their turns, a menu appears in front of them and they must
          choose their move quickly. The two groups trade hits on each
          other, but the bandits' higher experience and endurance
          begins to give them the upper hand. Taylor, who has the
          least amount of HP, staggers after taking a particularly
          painful arrow to the knee.

                              JAIME
                    It looks like your adventuring days
                    are over, mage.

                              SHAWN
                    Taylor! Are you okay?

                              TAYLOR
                    Do I look okay?

                              SHAWN
                    Maybe it's time you take that
                    health potion.

          She takes out the vial, unstoppers it, and drinks it. For a
          moment, it looks like she is recovering, but then she coughs
          and falls to her knees. A message on the HUD alerts the team
          that she's been paralyzed.

                              SHAWN
                    Taylor!

                              ERIC
                    What happened?

                              TAYLOR
                         (coughs)
                    I'm fine. I'm okay. I'm not taking
                    any damage, but I can't move.

          Eric and Shawn take out their vials and find that the red
          liquid has turned into a sickly yellow-green.

                              ERIC
                    It's poison!

                              SHAWN
                    What?! But that villager-!

                              ERIC
                    Tricked us. He was probably bribed
                    by the bandits.

                              SHAWN
                         (angry, exasperated)
                    Dammit.

          They toss their potions away and each stagger under another
          enemy attack. Shawn manages to steal himself some health
          from Jaime, while Eric treats him to a devastating sword
          slash.

                              SHAWN
                    I don't think we can beat them.
                    Especially with Taylor down.

                              ERIC
                    Don't worry. I have a plan.

                              SHAWN
                    What plan? What's the plan?

                              ERIC
                         (to the both of them)
                    You two just make sure you take
                    care of each other, okay?

                              SHAWN
                    What do you mean?

          Shawn hasn't yet noticed the small, but crucial, difference
          between his and Eric's respective HUDs. Underneath Eric's
          health bar is a red bar, which has slowly been filling as he
          has taken on damage. Ignoring Shawn, he taunts the bandits,
          drawing their attacks.

                              ERIC
                    Hey, you dirty, ugly, son of a
                    bitch, why don't you ditch your
                    slutty whore of a girlfriend and
                    try to face me one-on-one?

                              JESSA
                    How dare you!

                              JAIME
                    You go too far, cur!

          The bandits rain hit after hit on Eric, who is only just
          able to dodge or deflect them, waiting anxiously as the red
          bar above him slowly inches forward.

                              SHAWN
                    Eric! No!

          He tries to move forward to help, but finds himself stuck
          fast. It's not his turn, and he can't do anything but watch
          as his best friend is pummeled with attacks. The epic battle
          music playing around them swells as Eric's red bar is
          finally filled and in a red flash of light, he breaks
          Jaime's pattern of attack, rushing him with a shout.

          TO BE CONTINUED...
