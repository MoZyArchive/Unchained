
          INT. LOBBY - NIGHT

          Taylor and Shawn tumble out of the elevator on the right
          side of the room and fall flat on their faces. Behind them,
          the elevator dings and closes its doors.

                              SHAWN
                    Eric!

          He gets up and pounds on the door, trying to pry them open
          again. The door responds by opening slightly and slamming
          shut again, nearly catching his fingers and making him fall
          backwards.

                              SHAWN
                    Ow. Even the doors want to beat me
                    up here.

          Taylor has already gotten up and is heading for Linda's
          desk.

                              TAYLOR
                         (mostly angry, but also a
                         little bit desperate)
                    Hey, where's Eric? There's no way
                    that was real, so where are you
                    guys keeping him?

                              LINDA
                         (still playing her Gameboy)
                    He's safe. For now. He doesn't have
                    a whole lot of time though.

          She glances up at Taylor.

                              LINDA
                    And neither do you.

                              SHAWN
                         (getting up)
                    The curse. I still have to see the
                    Troll Prince.

          Linda points to the elevator on the left, the exact same one
          they went through earlier.

                              LINDA
                    Go on in.

                              SHAWN
                    But that's the same one we went on
                    before.

                              TAYLOR
                    I do not want to fight those stupid
                    bandits again.

                              LINDA
                    I know. Go on.

          Shawn and Taylor exchange looks and Taylor is a little
          surprised when Shawn takes her by the hand and begins
          leading her quickly towards the elevator.

                              SHAWN
                    C'mon. She's right. We don't have a
                    whole lot of time.

          Taylor reaches out, presses the button and she and Shawn
          step into it.

          INT. ELEVATOR - DAY

          The Muzak version of Keyboard Cat filters down around Taylor
          and Shawn, who are silent, both lost in their own heavy
          thoughts.

                              TAYLOR
                    He's okay. Eric, I mean. The
                    secretary said he was okay. We just
                    need to find a way to get him out.

          Shawn nods. Both of them jump the slightest bit when the
          elevator dings. Shawn steps in front of Taylor protectively
          as the doors open.

          INT. OFFICE - NIGHT

          The Troll Prince, ecstatic for his assumed victory against
          Shawn, dances wildly around his office to the song
          "Footloose", arms flailing and feet tapping. His victory is
          short-lived, as his phone rings and he rushes to turn off
          the music and smooth his hair. He sits down and, just before
          he answers, he takes a long sip of coffee from a mug on his
          desk.

                              LINDA
                    He passed the first trial and has
                    gone into the second.

          Coffee sprays everywhere on the desk as the Troll Prince
          spits it out in surprise and anger.

                              TROLL PRINCE
                    What?! How?!

                              LINDA
                    His big friend went berserk on the
                    bandits.

          The Troll Prince sneezes.

                              TROLL PRINCE
                    Ugh, Linda! How many times have I
                    told you not to alliterate? I've
                    told you. I'm allergic!

                              LINDA
                         (not sorry at all)
                    Sorry, sir.

                              TROLL PRINCE
                    Is my team ready?

                              LINDA
                    Yes, sir.

                              TROLL PRINCE
                    Excellent. I'll gear up and be
                    right in.

                              LINDA
                    Very good, sir.

          The Troll Prince slumps back into his chair and rubs his
          temples, feeling the beginnings of a headache coming on. He
          opens his eyes and is about to get up, when he finally
          notices the coffee all over his desk, keyboard, and monitor,
          which is displaying a sad Troll face. He reaches over to
          page Linda.

                              TROLL PRINCE
                    Tell the team I'm going to be a bit
                    late.

          EXT. BOMBED-OUT BUILDING - DAY

          The sharp rat-tat-tat of semi-automatics reaches the duo
          before their eyes adjust to the gloom. The floor beneath
          them shakes from the force of a nearby blast. Taylor finds
          herself armed to the teeth, awkwardly holding a big gun,
          while Shawn's eyes widen as he realizes where they might be.
          He blinks as a message types itself out in his vision.

          'MISSION: GET TO THE EVACUATION POINT IN FIVE MINUTES OR BE
          LEFT BEHIND'

          A map appears in the corner and a blinking red dot in the
          upper part of it catches his attention.

                              SHAWN
                    Dammit.

          He starts moving towards the area marked on the map.

                              TAYLOR
                    Wait, Shawn! How do you freaking
                    move in this game?

          Shawn turns to see Taylor spinning around in place. He runs
          over to her.

                              SHAWN
                    The left joystick, not the right
                    one. Right one controls the camera.

          She stops spinning and finally moves forward a few uncertain
          steps.

                              TAYLOR
                    Okay, now how to you shoot?

                              SHAWN
                    Right trigger.

          She shoots, nearly getting Shawn in the chest.

                              SHAWN
                    Whoa, wait until we see some
                    enemies first!

                              TAYLOR
                    Sorry! I suck at these!

          Â He runs and crouches down by the doorway, peering around to
          make sure it's clear.

                              SHAWN
                    C'mon! Stay close behind me!

                              TAYLOR
                    Wait! How do you throw a grenade?

          EXT. CLEARING - DAY

          The two of them exit the building, heading for an overturned
          car for cover.

                              TAYLOR
                    It's 'A' to jump, right?

          She jumps experimentally, then smacks Shawn upside the head
          with the butt of her gun.

                              SHAWN
                    Ow! What the hell!

                              TAYLOR
                    Sorry! I guess it's 'B' to hit
                    people?

          Shawn rubs the back of his head and tries not to let the
          pain get the better of him.

                              SHAWN
                    Yup. C'mon, we've gotta keep
                    moving.

          They move out towards an alleyway between two buildings.

          EXT. ALLEYWAY - DAY

          Shawn glances down the alleyway, then starts down it.

                              TAYLOR
                    Wait. That doesn't look very safe.

                              SHAWN
                    It's fine. They're most likely
                    waiting for us at the end of this,
                    but this is the quickest way to the
                    evac point.

                              TAYLOR
                    If you say so.

          They creep slowly down the alley, keeping an eye above them
          for snipers from the windows. About five feet before the end
          of the alley, Shawn holds up a hand to signal Taylor to
          stop.

          EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY

          From what they can see, the alleyway opens up into a lonely
          parking lot, two rusty and abandoned cars its only
          occupants, one to the left of them and the other to the
          right. Cranes, bulldozers, and a chain-link fence mark a
          construction site further down to the right. Shawn points to
          the car on the right.

                              SHAWN
                    Cover me.

                              TAYLOR
                    I thought you said they would be
                    waiting for us!

                              SHAWN
                    Yeah, but I don't know where they
                    are, which is why you have to cover
                    me. If they start shooting me, you
                    start shooting back.

          Taylor sighs, but shoulders her gun.

                              TAYLOR
                    Be careful.

          Shawn takes a deep breath to steel himself, inches to the
          corner to take a better look around, then moves swiftly to
          the abandoned car. He lets out a huge breath once he is
          behind cover, then motions to Taylor. She scurries over,
          plopping herself beside him.

                              SHAWN
                    So I guess there wasn't an ambush.

          Of course now is the time that a pair of enemies decide to
          jump out from behind the other car and start shooting at the
          two of them. Shawn shoves Taylor away from him and she runs
          back to the shelter of the alley, while he scrambles to the
          other side of the car. Both of them sustain a few hits and
          red flashes in their vision before fading away.

                              ENEMY SOLDIER #1
                    Got 'em pinned in the parking lot!

                              ENEMY SOLDIER #2
                    LOL! They walked right into it!

          Shawn drops down low and begins shooting at the enemies'
          feet. They jump and holler in pain, giving Taylor a chance
          to send a wild spray of bullets their way. She manages to
          dispatch one of them, but the other ducks behind the car,
          making sure to squat next to a wheel so Shawn won't be able
          to get at him.

                              ENEMY SOLDIER #2
                    Fuck! They got Jesse!

          Taylor continues pouring bullets into the enemy's hiding
          spot, but he waits patiently, knowing she will have to
          reload soon. There is a pause in the firing and the enemy
          takes advantage of the opportunity, popping up and aiming at
          the alley, only to fall from a shot to the head. Shawn is
          standing behind him. Taylor runs over to to dead body and
          dances over it in victory.

                              TAYLOR
                    Ha! In yo face!

          She holds her hand up for a high-five. Shawn obliges.

                              SHAWN
                    Let's go.
          tracking shot: shawn and taylor walking towards the
          construction, skirting the edge, and approaching a building.

          EXT. BUILDING - DAY

          Shawn and Taylor press themselves to the wall just outside
          the doorway.

                              SHAWN
                    Second floor of the building,
                    southeast corner.

                              TAYLOR
                    Southeast?

          Shawn points.

                              SHAWN
                    That corner. (pause) Okay, ready?

                              TAYLOR
                    To walk into another ambush and get
                    shot at? Yeah, sure. Why not?

          INT. BUILDING - DAY

          Shawn and Taylor rush into the room, both diving for the
          cover of old construction materials as bullets fly past them
          from the balcony above and in front of them. To either side
          of them, a set of stairs leads up to the second floor, the
          only path to where they need to go.

                              ENEMY SOLDIER #3
                    They've entered the building!

                              ENEMY SOLDIER #4
                    Bring it on, bitches!

          They trade fire back and forth, but Taylor and Shawn aren't
          able to make much progress towards the stairs, and neither
          do they know exactly how they are going to get up the stairs
          once they get there.

                              SHAWN
                    Well, got any ideas on how to get
                    past this?

          Taylor shrugs, but finally, inspiration strikes. She pulls
          out one grenade, yanks the pin out with her teeth, and Shawn
          looks confused, but then she pulls out another. He does the
          same and they both toss their grenades over their heads.
          They all land on the balcony.

                              ENEMY SOLDIER #3
                    Fire in the hole!

          One of them dives out of the way, falling halfway down the
          stairs, but the other is stupid enough to try and kick away
          four grenades before they explode and is caught in the
          blast. Shawn pops up from behind cover and kills the one on
          the stairs.

                              TAYLOR
                    Oh yeah! Teamwork!

                              SHAWN
                    We're almost there! The extraction
                    point is this way.

          He leads the way up the steps.

          INT. BUILDING, SECOND FLOOR - DAY

          The two finally are in sight of a glowing pillar of light,
          situated on a raised platform.

                              SHAWN
                    There it is! I can't believe we
                    made it!

          They run towards it, and it glows bright as Shawn crosses
          the boundary, but just before Taylor is able to step into
          the light, there is a gunshot. Shawn spins around as she
          falls.

                              SHAWN
                    Taylor!

          He drops to her side, even while the enemy team is still
          approaching, and shakes her. She is long gone.

                              SHAWN
                    Taylor.

          He hangs his head and his shoulders shake, but then
          suddenly, he stands up, ready to go all "Leroy Jenkins" on
          the enemy team. However, an elevator appears in the evac
          zone and an ally steps out of it, grabbing Shawn and bodily
          tossing him into the car.

          He begins shooting at the enemies, taking on damage. Shawn
          struggles to his feet and is about to step back out of the
          elevator car, but the doors suddenly close, taking him out
          of the game and leaving Taylor behind.
