          The shades are drawn, throwing horizontal stripes of light
          onto the opposite wall and draining the room of color. A fan
          situated on the desk in the middle of the room blows weakly
          on the still form reclining with its feet thrown up and its
          face hidden in the shadow of a fedora. Also on the desk is a
          sweating glass tumbler, half full with a clear, dark liquid.
          Slow jazz is playing in the background.

                              SHAWN
                         (voice over)
                    I had no idea what was coming my
                    way. But I should have.

          Someone is shouting outside in the living room. Eric is
          arguing with a female and their voices get louder as they
          approach Shawn's room.

                              SHAWN
                         (voice over)
                    I knew she was trouble when she
                    walked through my door. Trouble
                    with a capital "T".

          Taylor bursts in, breaking the 1920s film noir spell and
          revealing it's fakeness; the jazz is coming from an iPod
          dock, the liquid in the tumbler is just apple juice, and the
          fan is simply set on the lowest setting. Color jumps back
          into the shot and Shawn falls out of his seat, startled. She
          stomps up to the desk and slams her hands down on it.

                              TAYLOR
                    Why the hell are there picture of
                    me and you making out all over
                    Facebook?

          Shawn crouches behind the desk, using it as a shield between
          him and her. He reaches down for his fedora, which has
          fallen off his head, and shoves it back on as he stutters.

                              SHAWN
                    W-what? W-hat pictures? I'm not
                    even Facebook friends with you!

          Eric, who is standing behind Taylor, coughs guiltily.

                              SHAWN
                         (to Eric)
                    You traitor!

                              TAYLOR
                         (to Shawn)
                    You creeper! What did you do to me?
                    You must have done something or
                    given me something because I
                    wouldn't kiss you if you were the
                    last man on earth! You couldn't PAY
                    me enough to even THINK about
                    kissing you! Ugh!

          She kicks the desk and stomps back towards the door, pausing
          to turn and point an accusing finger at Shawn.

                              TAYLOR
                    You stay away from me, perv! I
                    never want to see your face again!

          She slams the door on her way out, leaving Eric and Shawn in
          the relative dark.

                              ERIC
                    Well, that went well.

          Shawn gives him an evil glare.

                              SHAWN
                    You suck, dude. Like a lot.

          Eric shrugs and opens the blinds, making Shawn blink in the
          sunlight. Shawn steps out from behind the desk and downs the
          rest of his apple juice.

                              ERIC
                    I was just curious how you got her
                    to make out with you.

                              SHAWN
                    'Cuz I got game, man!

                              ERIC
                    Uh-huh. Sure. You should probably
                    remove those photos before Taylor
                    comes back and rips your face off.
                    I probably won't be able to stop
                    her if she tries.

          Shawn sighs.

                              SHAWN
                    Yeah, I will...

          He signs on to Facebook and begins removing all the photos
          of him and Taylor. After a moment, an alert pops up, telling
          him he has new mail. He clicks on it and reads.

                              SHAWN
                    Once you start reading this, you
                    can't stop.

          A hypnotized look steals over Shawn's face.

                              SHAWN
                    Ashley Marie Jamison was 16 years
                    old...

          A series of images flashes in Shawn's mind, telling the
          story of a poor girl whose boyfriend cheated on her with her
          best friend. When she confronted her best friend, her friend
          pushed her down the stairs, snapping her neck and killing
          her. The best friend and the boyfriend were found dead soon
          afterwards, stabbed through the heart. A long, gradually
          quickening series of images - all of dead people, stabbed
          through the heart - ends with the gristly images of Shawn
          and Taylor, dead in the exact same way, and a timer, which
          is set for two hours, begins ticking down.

          Shawn blinks, coming back to reality. His eyes look up at
          the clock. It ticks once.

          INT. LIVING ROOM -DAY

          Eric is heading to the door with a tub full of laundry.
          Shawn suddenly steps out of his room, holding his laptop.

                              SHAWN
                    Hey, is there something wrong with
                    the internet? I can't get it to
                    work.

                              ERIC
                    Yeah, Andy left a note on
                    everyone's door saying it's going
                    to be down for maintenance until 5
                    or 6 tonight.

                              SHAWN
                    Curses!

          He goes back into his room and emerges fully clothed with
          his backpack on only seconds later, walking hurriedly to the
          door.

                              ERIC
                    Where are you going?

                              SHAWN
                    Library.

                              ERIC
                    Why?

                              SHAWN
                    Um... I guess you could say I'm a
                    little... er... paranoid.

                              ERIC
                    Oh, right. Don't wanna get your
                    face ripped off?

                              SHAWN
                    Not exactly, no.

                              ERIC
                    Alright, cool. See you later.

          EXT. LIBRARY - DAY

          Shawn's bike screeches to a stop outside the public library
          and he hops off, not even bothering to put it in a bike
          rack. He races for the door.
          slow mo: Shawn's hand reaching for the door handle. the
          instant his hand makes contact...

          INT. LIBRARY - DAY
          cut to: Library computers going wonky - flashing, shutting
          down, displaying error signs.

          People look around, confused, and the library techs begin
          scurrying around, trying to figure out what's wrong. Shawn
          comes onto the scene, somewhat bewildered at the amount of
          activity going on. He heads to the information desk.

                              SHAWN
                    Hey, what's the password for your
                    guys' wifi?

                              LIBRARIAN
                    Um, it should be your student ID
                    number, but something's gone wrong
                    with the wireless and it doesn't
                    look like it's working.

                              SHAWN
                    What? Why?

                              LIBRARIAN
                    How should I know? I just check
                    people's books out for them.

                              SHAWN
                    Are there any places nearby that
                    have free wifi?

                              LIBRARIAN
                    There's a cafe a few blocks that
                    way.

          She points and Shawn is off like a shot. On his way out, he
          bumps into a young man and making him drop the stack of
          books he is carrying.

                              SHAWN
                    Sorry!

          As Shawn bikes away, the computers all go back to normal and
          everything seems perfectly fine.

          MONTAGE

          Shawn bikes all over town, to a coffee shop, an art lounge,
          another library, and even an early-opening bar, but there is
          no luck anywhere. The moment he arrives at one place, the
          computers there begin freaking out, or the wireless suddenly
          shuts down. The moment he steps off the property, everything
          goes back to normal. Shawn gets more and more frustrated and
          sweaty as the day wears on. He checks the time and he's
          almost out. Finally, he just goes home, flops down on the
          couch, and gives up. He sits there a few minutes, trying to
          catch his breath, before Eric comes in the door, fresh from
          work.

                              ERIC
                    Hey.

          He glances at Shawn, then does a double take.

                              ERIC
                    Did you get those photos down?

          Shawn just shakes his head and collapses further into the
          couch. His phone beeps and he pulls it out, revealing one
          new voicemail. He listens to it.

                              MARIANA
                    Hey, Shawnie, it's Mariana. So, uh,
                    long time no see, right? Anyways, I
                    was just, um, wondering if maybe
                    you wanted to hang out sometime.
                    Just for old times' sake? Well, um,
                    call me back. I miss you. (long
                    pause) Bye.

          Shawn looks at the phone in disbelief.

                              SHAWN
                    Eric, I think Mariana just called
                    me.

                              ERIC
                    Really? Why? She broke up with you
                    ages ago.

                              SHAWN
                    I dunno. It sounded like she wanted
                    to get back together.

                              ERIC
                    Don't do it, man. She's only gonna
                    break your heart again.

          Shawn shrugs.

          INT. SHAWN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Shawn stares up at the ceiling, blankets wrapped up around
          him, unblinking. The clock on his nightstand tells him it's
          11:59. He closes his eyes and sighs, trying to sleep.

                              SHAWN
                    Just a stupid email. Dumb luck.

          There is a moment of silence, quiet, stillness. Shawn takes
          a breath. Suddenly, his bed shakes ever so slightly, and his
          eyes fly open. For a moment, he is frozen in disbelief and
          fear. The bed shakes again, more violently, and Shawn sits
          up and casts his eyes around for a weapon, but finds
          nothing.

                              SHAWN
                    Eric?

          The bed shakes again, even more violently, and Shawn jumps
          up, standing on his bed and looking around over the sides of
          it.

                              SHAWN
                    Eric!

          The next shake is so powerful that it causes Shawn to lose
          his balance, almost falling off the bed completely. He peers
          over the edge ever so slowly, part of him still in denial
          that this could really be happening and the other part
          utterly terrified. Suddenly a hand reaches out from under
          the bed and Shawn screeches and jumps back as the rest of a
          girl's body follows the hand. She is holding a knife and her
          hair is long and hanging in her face; her eyes are wide and
          bloodshot, and her neck is tilted at a grotesque angle.

                              SHAWN
                    ERIC! ERIC! HOLY SHIT! GET AWAY
                    FROM ME!

          The ghost girl snaps her neck back in place and lunges
          across the bed at Shawn. Suddenly the door bursts open and
          Eric, in his pajamas and armed with a baseball bat and a
          catcher's mask, leaps into the room. He is shocked for a
          moment at the strange girl, but spots the knife and
          immediately whacks her across the face with the baseball
          bat, while Shawn takes out her legs with the chair. She
          collapses to the ground with a shriek. The two boys look at
          each other for a moment, breathing hard.

                              ERIC
                    Holy shit, dude! Where the fuck did
                    you pick up this psycho?

                              SHAWN
                    I didn't pick her up! She's a
                    ghost! I didn't send on the email
                    and she tried to kill me!

                              ERIC
                    A ghost? Dude, are you crazy!?
                    She's right there!

          Eric gestures and they both look, but the girl is
          mysteriously gone.

                              ERIC
                    What the fuck? She was right
                    here...

                              SHAWN
                         (cuts Eric off)
                    Oh, God! Taylor!

          He darts out of the room.

          INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

          Shawn grabs a pan from off the stove on his way to the door,
          but smacks into it in his desperation to open it.

                              ERIC
                    Shawn, where are you going? What
                    the fuck is going on?

          Shawn explains as he goes out of the apartment and begins
          banging on Taylor's door.

          INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

                              SHAWN
                    I got a chain letter that said if I
                    didn't send it on to 20 people that
                    a ghost would come at midnight to
                    kill me and the one I love!
                    (shouting) Taylor! Taylor, are you
                    okay?

                              ERIC
                    So you're going to break into her
                    apartment?

                              SHAWN
                    If I have to, yeah!

          The door suddenly swings open.

                              TAYLOR
                    What the hell do you guys want?

          Behind her, Eric and Shawn see the ghost girl, rising up
          from behind the sofa.

          INT. TAYLOR'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

          Shawn and Eric rush in, ignoring Taylor's protests. The
          ghost girl lunges for them and they dive out of the way. She
          begins crawling quickly across the floor towards Shawn, who
          scoots away and kicks at her as she approaches. The ghost is
          almost upon him, her shining silver knife raised to stab him
          through the heart when Eric tackles her sideways. The knife
          goes skittering away and as Eric rolls off of her, the girl
          shrieks and jumps out an open window. Taylor runs to the
          window and looks down, but sees no body on the pavement
          below. She slowly turns around. Clearly shaken, she sinks
          down to the floor.

                              SHAWN
                    Taylor, are you okay?

          He moves to her and tries to put an arm around her, but she
          shakes him off.

                              TAYLOR
                    Who the fucking fuck was that?!

                              ERIC
                    Yeah, Shawn, who was that?

          Shawn looks at the both of them, hesitant to actually tell
          them his theory.

                              SHAWN
                    Uh... I'm pretty sure that was a
                    ghost.

                              TAYLOR
                         (pause)
                    A what?

                              SHAWN
                    Well, I read a chain letter that
                    said a ghost would kill me and my
                    crush if I didn't send it on, and I
                    think that was the ghost.

                              ERIC
                         (pause)
                    That's the stupidest thing I've
                    ever heard.

                              SHAWN
                    Well, it worked with you to!
                    (pointing to Taylor)

                              TAYLOR
                    What worked?

                              SHAWN
                    The chain letter! I passed on a
                    chain letter that said my true love
                    would kiss me if I did, and then...
                    well, you know.

          Taylor makes a disgusted face at being reminded.

                              SHAWN
                    I think... the chain letters that I
                    read might be coming true.

          Eric shakes his head.

                              ERIC
                    Shawn, there are no such things as
                    ghosts and there is no freaking way
                    chain letters have any effect on
                    your day beside being annoying.

                              SHAWN
                    Well, then who the hell was that
                    girl?

                              ERIC
                    I don't know, but ghosts! Don't!
                    Exist!

                              SHAWN
                    But it makes sense!

                              TAYLOR
                    Look, guys, thanks for saving me
                    from... whatever that thing was,
                    but I think we should call the
                    police.

                              SHAWN
                    They're not going to be able to do
                    anything about a ghost.

                              TAYLOR AND ERIC
                    Shut up, Shawn.

          Taylor moves to make the call, while Shawn continues
          imploring them to believe him.

                              SHAWN
                    I'm not kidding around, guys! I
                    think they're coming true! I'm
                    pretty sure I read somewhere about
                    some guy and he...
          fade to black

          TO BE CONTINUED...
