          Shawn and Eric are sitting on the floor, playing Mario Kart
          Wii, and Shawn is clearly winning. Taylor sits on the couch
          behind them, watching with a smile on her face.

                              SHAWN
                    Ha! Take that, loser!

                              ERIC
                    That was a cheap shot!

                              SHAWN
                    What are you talking about? Blue
                    shells are perfectly legitimate!

                              ERIC
                    Yeah, well so is this.

                              SHAWN
                    What? No! You stop that right now!
                    Ugh!

          Eric wins, earning himself a high five from Taylor. Shawn
          sulks.

                              TAYLOR
                    Nice job, Eric.

                              SHAWN
                    I hate this game.

                              ERIC
                    You were the one who asked me to
                    play.

          Shawn's sulking is interrupted by a text tone. Taylor takes
          out her phone.

                              TAYLOR
                    Hey, my friend Danielle just texted
                    me and said she and a bunch of her
                    friends are going out for a drink
                    in a bit. Did you guys wanna come?

                              ERIC
                    Sure. Sounds fun.

          He grabs his keys and wallet from the kitchen counter, while
          Taylor also preps herself to head out. Shawn stays where he
          is, sitting on the floor. He watches them uncertainly until
          they are almost at the door. Taylor turns back with a
          questioning look.

                              TAYLOR
                    Shawn? You coming?

          Shawn hesitates and opens his mouth to answer, but his
          laptop, which is sitting on the dining room table, alerts
          him to a new email. All three of them look at it, then Eric
          and Taylor look back at Shawn. He gazes at it for a long,
          long moment, then moves towards it. Eric and Taylor are
          slightly disappointed, and maybe just a little bit
          apprehensive, until Shawn reaches out closes it. He smiles
          at them as he also grabs his keys, phone, and wallet.

                              SHAWN
                    Yeah. I think I will.

                              ERIC
                    Well I guess miracles really do
                    happen.

                              SHAWN
                    Shut up.

          The three of them head out the door and it closes behind
          them. Their bickering and laughter can be heard in the
          hallway as the camera zooms in on Shawn's laptop.

          Fade out.
