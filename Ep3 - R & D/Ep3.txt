          Shawn is doing his business on company time. In his grey,
          soulless cubicle, at his drab and lifeless job, he searches
          a few things and scrolls through a few pages, carefully
          avoiding any links that even look like they might be simply
          chain letters, waiting for him to read them. Finally, he
          strikes what he believes is gold. He clicks the link, which
          leads him to a forum with a Gothic-designed banner across
          the top. Shawn reads it.

                              SHAWN
                    The Prisoners' Guild...

          He clicks on the 'About' link and reads again.

                              SHAWN
                    Those who are forced together by
                    unbreakable chains, suffer from an
                    unending curse, and endure the rage
                    of the Troll Prince. Wow.
                    Melodramatic bunch, aren't they?
                    Meeting tonight at 7 in the Johnson
                    Computer Science Building, Lab 108.
                    Hm.

          The camera zooms out on the back of Shawn's head, and his
          superior, Greg, comes into view, peering over the cubicle
          wall. Greg glares knives at the back of Shawn's head, then
          looks at a very carefully taped-back-together sheet of paper
          in his hand, which is labeled "How to Make Shawn's Life a
          Living Hell."

                              GREG
                    SHAWN! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

          Shawn jumps and quickly closes out of the window, stuttering
          excuses as he goes. Greg comes around the wall and into
          Shawn's cubicle to better berate him.

                              GREG
                    This is why you're worthless,
                    Shawn. Worthless! You're always
                    screwing around and wasting
                    valuable time. I honestly don't
                    know why we hired you.

          Shawn does his best to be apologetic, but it is clear he is
          seething inside.

                              SHAWN
                    Sorry, sir. I'll get back to work
                    right away, sir.

                              

                              GREG
                    Good. I'll be watching you to make
                    sure. I'm like Ceiling Cat. I see
                    everything.

          Greg heads back into his own cubicle and Shawn makes faces
          at his back. He suddenly spins around and makes the "I've
          got my eyes on you" motion.

                              GREG
                    Watching you, Shawn! Always
                    watching.

          Shawn sighs and gets back to work.

          INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

          Shawn is looking around for Lab 108. Behind him, Eric and
          Taylor are arguing.

                              TAYLOR
                    I cannot believe you think that
                    this "email curse" is real.

                              ERIC
                    Look, I don't believe a word of
                    what he's saying, but if we don't
                    prove him wrong, he's just going to
                    keep annoying us about it.

                              TAYLOR
                    Well, he'll forget about it
                    eventually, right?

                              ERIC
                    I don't think so. He spent five
                    weeks researching real world
                    equivalents of all the parts of the
                    Millennium Falcon so he could build
                    one for himself. So far he's about
                    $18,000 dollars short and 20 to 25
                    years away.

          Taylor gives Eric an incredulous look.

                              ERIC
                    With any luck, these "Prisoners"
                    will convince him it's all in his
                    head, and we'll laugh about it over
                    some shawarma.

          Taylor sighs.

                              TAYLOR
                    Fine. But I'm not paying for it.

          Shawn finally spots the lab and runs towards it.

                              SHAWN
                    There it is! C'mon, guys!

                              ERIC
                         (after a beat, to Taylor)
                    How did he get you to kiss him,
                    though?

          INT. COMPUTER LAB - NIGHT

          Except for the glow of 21 computer screens, the room is
          dark. The only sound in the room is the quiet buzz of fans.
          Shawn, Eric, and Taylor enter, blinking until their eyes
          adjust, then looking unsettled by what they see. At each of
          the computers stands a figure in long dark robes, silent and
          unmoving. On all the computers, a countdown is getting
          closer and closer to zero. The newcomers exchange looks
          uncertainly. The countdown reaches zero and as soon as it
          does, all the robed figures in the room sit down at their
          desks and begin furiously typing and clicking. By the looks
          of it, they are all on their email, checking, sending, and
          forwarding.

                              ERIC
                    Huh. Somewhat anticlimactic.

          The three of them stand there for a moment, unsure of what
          to do, when suddenly the leader of the Prisoners looks up at
          them. He pauses, as if studying them, then stands up
          swiftly, knocking back his chair, and stomps over to them.
          As he speaks, he flings back the hood of his robes and
          glares at Shawn.

                              LEADER
                    What in the Basement Cat are you
                    doing here, intern?

          Shawn is shocked to see his superior, Greg, glaring at him.

                              SHAWN
                    You're the leader of the
                    Prisoners?!

                              GREG
                    Yeah, and I want you out of here.
                    Now.

          He begins herding the three of them out, rather forcefully.

                              TAYLOR
                    Hey! Wait a minute! Would you just-

          She plants her feet and grabs Greg's arm.

                              TAYLOR
                    Look, would you please just talk to
                    him?

          Taylor gives him her best puppy-eyed look and even sticks
          out her lower lip a little. Greg is unaffected. Eric leans
          in between them.

                              ERIC
                    He thinks that the chain letters he
                    reads are coming true.

          Greg turns to Eric, then to Shawn, and the glare on his face
          turns into a malicious grin. He gives them a little push.

                              GREG
                    We can talk outside.

          INT. LOBBY - NIGHT

          The four of them are seated around a low coffee table in
          comfy looking armchairs.

                              GREG
                         (smiling devilishly at Shawn,
                         who looks unnerved)
                    You've been cursed, intern. You're
                    one of us now.

                              SHAWN, ERIC, AND TAYLOR
                    What?

                              GREG
                    The curse of the chain letters! All
                    of us Prisoners have it. Welcome to
                    the family!

                              TAYLOR
                    Wait, so you think it's real too?

                              GREG
                    Think? No, babe, I know. I've had
                    it for nine years now. The longest
                    out of all of us. I pass on ALL the
                    chain letters now. I didn't believe
                    it at first, but once I lost my
                    job, my wife-

                              SHAWN
                    You were married?

                              GREG
                         (ignoring him)
                    -my house... well, it was tough to
                    ignore the signs. After some
                    looking around on the intertubes, I
                    discovered some other people with
                    the same... condition, and we
                    founded the Prisoners.

                              SHAWN
                    So, do you know why or how or who
                    did this to you?

                              GREG
                    Why do you wanna know? You gonna
                    try to do something about it?

                              SHAWN
                    Well, sure... why not?

                              GREG
                         (puts his hands up)
                    Well, I guess you're a little more
                    badass than I thought!

                              SHAWN
                    Uh... thanks?

                              GREG
                    You're welcome. Anyways, what we've
                    discovered in our years as internet
                    addicts is that the guy you're
                    looking for is called the Troll
                    Prince. He works in a company
                    building out in the industrial
                    section of town.

                              ERIC
                    A company? What company? What does
                    this Troll Prince do exactly?

          An indistinct figure passes behind the conversing quartet,
          dressed in Prisoner's robes. They take no notice of him.

                              GREG
                    He makes our lives miserable is
                    what he does. I don't know what the
                    company is called. It's always just
                    been called "The Company."

                              TAYLOR
                    A company called The Company.
                    Original.

          INT. COMPUTER LAB - NIGHT

          The same figure enters, unnoticed by anyone else. We are now
          able to make out his face more clearly. He heads straight
          for Greg's station and sits down.

                              GREG
                         (voice over)
                    All that we know about the company
                    itself is that it seems to run the
                    internet. The Troll Prince is
                    obviously the one in charge.

          In the light of the computer the young man's face is as
          clear as day. It's the news anchor who reported on the fire
          station fire a few days before, as well as the hipster dude
          who Shawn bumped into earlier today. He smiles as he takes
          out a jump drive and inserts it.

                              GREG
                         (voice over)
                    Every single chain letter we've
                    ever encountered can be traced back
                    to him. He's started hundreds of
                    thousands of flame wars on all
                    sorts of sites. I tried facing him,
                    years ago.
                         (shudders)
                    Figured I'd just learn to live with
                    it after that.

          The young man opens the jump drive and the cursor moves
          towards a file named "Not a Virus, trust me, I'm a dolphin",
          with an icon of a dolphin on it. His smile turns into a
          devilish grin and his eyes flicker.

                              YOUNG MAN
                    Oh, Dolphin. I do trust you.

                              GREG
                         (voice over)
                    Basically wherever people gather on
                    the internet, he's there.

          He clicks it.

          Suddenly, the computer screen flickers and goes dark. Other
          computers nearby also do the same. The Troll face pops up on
          one, then another, then another, and people begin freaking
          out in confusion, surprise, and anger. They run around,
          looking for the cause and the solution to the problem, and
          in the chaos, the young man suddenly vanishes.

          INT. LOBBY - NIGHT

                              SHAWN
                    Why are you being so helpful all of
                    a sudden? I thought you hated me.

                              GREG
                    I do. I just can't wait to see you
                    epically fail.

          A Prisoner interrupts the conversation by running out to
          them, out of breath.

                              PRISONER
                    Hey, boss, something's gone wrong.

          INT. COMPUTER LAB - NIGHT

          Greg, Shawn, Taylor and Eric enter and survey the damage.
          The computer screen flash and fizzle, showing bits of static
          black and white fuzz interspersed with the Troll face.  Greg
          begins typing away at his station, but it has no effect.

                              GREG
                    Report!

                              PRISONER #1
                    All stations unresponsive, sir!

                              PRISONER #2
                    No clear cause of the problem, sir!

                              PRISONER #3
                    Sir! We've still got a few of us
                    that need to relay their letters
                    back!

                              GREG
                    Hollum! Check 109! See if there's
                    anyone in there. If not, take the
                    people who need access and make
                    sure they relay their letters. On
                    the double rainbow! Go! Move!

          Suddenly all the screens go dark. Everyone pauses, holding
          their breath. Greg stiffens, realizing what is about to
          happen.

                              GREG
                    AVERT YOUR EYES!

          All the Prisoners duck down or cover their eyes. One guy
          even punches through his monitor with a shriek. The same
          message begins scrolling across all the screens, and Shawn
          is just a little too slow on the pick up to realize he
          should have closed his eyes too. The message says "Once you
          read this, you can't stop."

          A series of images flashes on the computer screen and Shawn
          is hypnotized by them. Eric and Taylor shake him, but his
          eyes remain fixed on the screen. They watch the series of
          images with him, becoming more and more disturbed.

          The young man from earlier smiling, holding his arms out in
          a "come at me bro" style, Shawn and Eric battling it out
          with video games, Shawn and Taylor waiting awkwardly next to
          each other for the elevator, the young man laughing
          maniacally, typing furiously in an austere, white office,
          Eric dead on the street, blood all around him, Taylor dead
          in her room from a gunshot to the chest, Eric drowning,
          Taylor trapped in a fire, image after image of Taylor and
          Eric dying in horrible ways. Shawn jerks out of his trance 
          as the final message flashes on the screen.

          "Forward this message to 1,000,000 people in 24 hours or
          they will die."

          The computers all shut down and reboot, seemingly fine
          again. Shawn looks at first Eric, then Taylor, with a
          shocked expression on  his face. They stare back at him, the
          beginnings of belief in their eyes.

                              TAYLOR
                    Shawn?

          Shawn shakes Greg, who has curled up into a ball on his
          rolling chair.

                              SHAWN
                    I need that address.

          TO BE CONTINUED...
