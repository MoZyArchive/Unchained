          Shawn exits the elevator, stricken by Taylor's 'death'.
          Linda looks up at him from her place behind the front desk
          and gives him a pitying smile.

                              LINDA
                    Lost another one, huh?

          Shawn gives her his saddest, most adorable, puppy face ever.
          She turns off her game.

                              LINDA
                    Here, kid.

          She presses a button and Taylor and Eric materialize, both
          lounging in comfortable looking chairs. Taylor is snoring
          loud enough to wake the dead and Eric is curled up, sucking
          his thumb. Shawn rushes over to them.

                              SHAWN
                    Eric! Taylor!

          He shakes them but they remain dead asleep.

                              LINDA
                    They're not going to wake up until
                    you defeat the Troll Prince. And if
                    my clock is right, you've got... an
                    hour and 22 minutes to do that
                    before the chain letter comes true.

                              SHAWN
                    What? Only an hour and a half? I
                    thought I had a whole 24 hours!

          Linda glances to the elevator.

                              LINDA
                    Time passes differently in the game
                    zones. It's a whole 'nother
                    universe in there.

          Shawn checks once more to make sure Eric and Taylor are
          okay, then heads towards the elevator. As he reaches out to
          press the button, Linda calls to him.

                              LINDA
                    Wait!

          He turns, confused and wary, as she approaches him.

                              LINDA
                    Wanna know a secret?

          INT. THE TROLL PRINCE'S OFFICE - SOMETIME

          The Troll Prince sits sedately at his desk in the middle of
          the very large room, writing something in a notebook. Other
          than the desk, which has a computer on it, the room is
          empty. For once, the computer is in sleep mode. It is quiet,
          except for the scribbling of the Troll Prince's pencil.
          Shawn stands at the door, looking around, confused.

                              SHAWN
                    Um, hello?

          The Troll Prince continues writing, pointedly ignoring
          Shawn.

                              SHAWN
                    Uh, hello? Are you the Troll
                    Prince?

          The Troll Prince's writing gets faster. CLOSE UP: The Troll
          Prince's notebook, which is just filled with scribbles. He's
          only scribbling in order to appear busy.

                              SHAWN
                         (angry)
                    Hey! Who the fuck are you?

          The Troll Prince finally stops writing and looks up. He
          reaches over to pick up a plaque sitting on his desk and
          hold it up. It reads "Troll Prince."

                              SHAWN
                    Oh.

                              TROLL PRINCE
                    It's nice to finally meet you IRL,
                    KingofPranks244-slash-TrollinatorX-
                    slash-ShawnoftheBread.

                              SHAWN
                    How-how do you know all my screen
                    names?

                              TROLL PRINCE
                         (shrugs)
                    It's my job.

                              SHAWN
                    Your job?

                              TROLL PRINCE
                    My purpose.

                              SHAWN
                    You get paid to- to troll people
                    and spread hate on the internet?

                              TROLL PRINCE
                    No. I don't get paid. At least, not
                    in the traditional sense.

                              SHAWN
                    Really? Then why do you do it?

          The Prince slowly stands up, locking eyes with Shawn. As he
          speaks, the office grows dimmer and dimmer and fire springs
          up, lining the edges of the room. The flames grow higher and
          hotter, herding Shawn close to the middle of the room. Jets
          of flame shoot up from the ground, forcing Shawn to dodge
          around them, sometimes falling to the ground and only
          scooting away just in time.

                              TROLL PRINCE
                    For glory and honor!

          Shawn jumps as a wall of fire springs up behind him. The
          Troll Prince salutes.

                              TROLL PRINCE
                    For fame and adoration!

          T.P. gets up onto his desk and strikes a pose. Shawn dodges
          a jet of flame.

                              TROLL PRINCE
                    To denounce the evils of truth and
                    love!

          T.P.'s hair, blown about by the hot wind now roaring through
          his office, takes on the shape of horns, and a fiery glow is
          reflected in his eyes. Shawn is finally less than six feet
          in front of the desk, confronted with a demon who is finally
          showing his true colors.

                              TROLL PRINCE
                         (shouting)
                    So the whole world will know of my
                    power! (maniacal laughter)

          The Troll Prince's evil laughter is interrupted by a beep as
          his secretary, Linda, comes on the intercom.

                              LINDA
                    Sir, you have a phone call on line
                    one.

          The Troll Prince's spell is broken; the fires die down and
          the lights come up again. He groans and stamps his foot.

                              TROLL PRINCE
                    Goddammit, Linda, I thought I said
                    to hold all my calls!

                              LINDA
                    It's your mom.

                              TROLL PRINCE
                    Tell her I'm busy, for fuck's sake!

                              LINDA
                         (speaking to someone else)
                    He's busy, for fuck's sake.

                              TROLL PRINCE
                    No, don't- Ugh. Don't tell her THAT
                    part! Ugh. What a bitch.

                              LINDA
                    He says you're a bitch.

                              TROLL PRINCE
                         (shouting)
                    No! I meant you, Linda. You're a
                    bitch!

                              LINDA
                    Oh, he's calling me a bitch. My
                    mistake.

                              TROLL PRINCE
                         (shouting)
                    Tell my mom I'll call her back and
                    hold all my calls!

                              LINDA
                    Yes, sir.

                              TROLL PRINCE
                         (shouting)
                    And get the hell off the intercom!

                              LINDA
                    Yes, sir.

          The Troll Prince groans and begins massaging his forehead.

                              TROLL PRINCE
                    FML.

          Shawn coughs, having been ignored again for the entire
          exchange.

                              SHAWN
                    So, um, you wanna, like, remove
                    this curse thing you put on me?
                    Please? The one where all the chain
                    letters I read come true? It's
                    getting kind of annoying.

                              TROLL PRINCE
                         (forcefully)
                    Good! And no! I'm never going to
                    lift your curse.

                              SHAWN
                    What? Why not? I passed through all
                    your stupid tests!

                              TROLL PRINCE
                    Because you're a douchebag, and I
                    hate you!

                              SHAWN
                    What? You're a douchebag, and I
                    hate you!

                              TROLL PRINCE
                    And you haven't even passed all the
                    tests, n00b.

                              SHAWN
                    What are you talking about?

          Slowly, the room begins to darken as flame again begin
          licking up around the edges. The Troll Prince, who is still
          standing up on the desk, crouches down, staring into Shawn's
          eyes with his flaming ones as his hair again stands up into
          little demon horns.

                              TROLL PRINCE
                    You still have to defeat me.

          EXT. SQUARE - DAY

          Shawn looks around at the crowd of people surrounding him
          and the Troll Prince. His opponent is dressed in black,
          while he is dressed in white and is sporting a white
          headband. The crowd cheers as the Troll Prince crouches into
          a battle stance and a booming voice that seems to emanate
          from nowhere and yet everywhere shouts out.

                              VOICE
                    A challenger appears! Three! Two!
                    One! Fight!

          Shawn looks around in confusion and is rewarded for his
          hesitation with a hard punch to the jaw.

                              SHAWN
                    Ow! What was that for?

                              TROLL PRINCE
                    Didn't you hear the voice? He said
                    'Fight'!

          Shawn tries out a few experimental punches and kicks. His
          face lights up as he realizes that he knows this game pretty
          well. He and the Troll Prince trade punches and kicks,
          flipping, jumping and generally trying to showing off as
          much as they are fighting each other. However, the Troll
          Prince is always one step ahead of Shawn, leaving him on the
          ground, punching at nothing, and often making a fool of
          himself.

                              TROLL PRINCE
                    It's no use, fool! You can't
                    possibly beat me. This is MY world!

                              SHAWN
                    Well, if I can't possibly beat you,
                    why the hell did you bring me here?

                              TROLL PRINCE
                    Because! I wanted you to suffer.

                              SHAWN
                    What? Why? What have I ever done to
                    you? I've never even met you before
                    now!

                              TROLL PRINCE
                    Oh really?

          The Troll Prince pauses his attacking. He quickly shifts
          through all the disguises he's taken: the news reporter, the
          hipster, the Prisoner, the NPC villager, the elevator ally.
          Shawn is shocked into silence.

                              TROLL PRINCE
                    You downvoted my post on Reddit.
                    You reported my comment on Youtube.
                    And you got me banned from that
                    forum!

                              SHAWN
                    So what? Everyone does that to
                    everyone else!

                              TROLL PRINCE
                    No one does that to me.

          The Troll Prince redoubles his attacks, hammering Shawn with
          blows which he is barely able to block. The crowd cheers on.
          Shawn finally decides it's time to unleash his secret
          weapon.

                              SHAWN
                    Hate to break it to you, Prince.
                    But I want my friends back. And
                    nothing - not even you - is going
                    to stop me. Alligators alleviate
                    allergies!

          The Troll Prince lets out a giant sneeze, which allows Shawn
          to get in a punch.

                              TROLL PRINCE
                         (shocked)
                    What? How did you-?

                              SHAWN
                    Barking baritones barricade the
                    bar!

          The Troll Prince sneezes even louder and his eyes start
          watering. Shawn continues his attack pattern, which the
          Troll Prince recognizes, but is weakening too quickly to
          stop it.

                              TROLL PRINCE
                    Stop it! That's not fair! You can't
                    do that!

                              SHAWN
                    Carving caricatures of careful
                    cats!

          The Troll Prince breaks into hives as he falls to his knees,
          shouting as Shawn finishes the attack (the Konami Code).

                              TROLL PRINCE
                    Nooooooooooooooooooooooooo!

          The crowd cheers as the booming voice announces the winner.
          Shawn grins and basks in the glory.

                              VOICE
                    K.O. Winner! Shawn!

          INT. LOBBY - NIGHT

          Shawn suddenly finds himself back in the lobby with a
          smirking Linda.

                              LINDA
                    Nice job, kid.

          She looks over at Eric and Taylor, who are beginning to wake
          up.

                              SHAWN
                    Eric! Taylor! You're okay!

          He squeezes Eric, who appears confused but is too sleepy to
          complain, and then Taylor, who reflexively whacks him in the
          face.

                              TAYLOR
                    Oops. Sorry.

                              ERIC
                    I guess that means you beat him?

                              SHAWN
                    Yeah! I did!

          He looks back up to Linda, who is still smirking amusedly at
          them.

                              SHAWN
                    Thanks.

                              LINDA
                    No problem. Never really liked that
                    guy anyways.

          Her phone rings and she picks it up.

                              LINDA
                    Hello? (pause) Oh, yes, sir. (she
                    holds the phone out to Shawn) It's
                    for you.

          Shawn takes it apprehensively.

                              SHAWN
                    Uh, hello?

                              TROLL KING
                    So you're the famous Shawn, eh? You
                    sound like a twelve year old.

                              SHAWN
                         (voice breaking)
                    What?

                              TROLL KING
                    Don't worry about it, kid. That's
                    perfect. I've got a job for you.

                              SHAWN
                    A job?

                              TROLL KING
                    The Princess' job. He was screwing
                    everything up anyways, and I've
                    been looking for someone to replace
                    him for ages. (to Linda) LINDA!
                    TELL THE PRINCESS HE'S FIRED!

                              LINDA
                    Right away, sir.

                              TROLL KING
                    You've got spirit, kid. I like
                    that. Whatdya say coming to work
                    for me? I've read your record.
                    You're online a helluva long time
                    every day and your work is amatuer,
                    but it's got potential. You could
                    do what you love and get paid for
                    it.

                              SHAWN
                    Paid? But didn't the Troll Prince
                    say-?

                              TROLL KING
                    Well, not exactly "paid", but you'd
                    get to do what you want and no one
                    but me would get to yell at you for
                    it.

          There is a pregnant pause as Shawn considers his options.
          Linda nods encouragingly, but Eric and Taylor, now more
          awake, put their hands up in alarm. After some time, Shawn
          gives his answer.

                              SHAWN
                    Thanks, Mr. Troll King, but I think
                    I'll pass.

          INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

          Shawn and Eric are sitting on the floor, playing Mario Kart
          Wii, and Shawn is clearly winning. Taylor sits on the couch
          behind them, watching with a smile on her face.

                              SHAWN
                    Ha! Take that, loser!

                              ERIC
                    That was a cheap shot!

                              SHAWN
                    What are you talking about? Blue
                    shells are perfectly legitimate!

                              ERIC
                    Yeah, well so is this.

                              SHAWN
                    What? No! You stop that right now!
                    Ugh!

          Eric wins, earning himself a high five from Taylor. Shawn
          sulks.

                              TAYLOR
                    Nice job, Eric.

                              SHAWN
                    I hate this game.

                              ERIC
                    You were the one who asked me to
                    play.

          Shawn's sulking is interrupted by a text tone. Taylor takes
          out her phone.

                              TAYLOR
                    Hey, my friend Danielle just texted
                    me and said she and a bunch of her
                    friends are going out for a drink
                    in a bit. Did you guys wanna come?

                              ERIC
                    Sure. Sounds fun.

          He grabs his keys and wallet from the kitchen counter, while
          Taylor also preps herself to head out. Shawn stays where he
          is, sitting on the floor. He watches them uncertainly until
          they are almost at the door. Taylor turns back with a
          questioning look.

                              TAYLOR
                    Shawn? You coming?

          Shawn hesitates and opens his mouth to answer, but his
          laptop, which is sitting on the dining room table, alerts
          him to a new email. All three of them look at it, then Eric
          and Taylor look back at Shawn. He gazes at it for a long,
          long moment, then moves towards it. Eric and Taylor are
          slightly disappointed, and maybe just a little bit
          apprehensive, until Shawn reaches out closes it. He smiles
          at them as he also grabs his keys, phone, and wallet.

                              SHAWN
                    Yeah. I think I will.

                              ERIC
                    Well I guess miracles really do
                    happen.

                              SHAWN
                    Shut up.

          The three of them head out the door and it closes behind
          them. Their bickering and laughter can be heard in the
          hallway as the camera zooms in on Shawn's laptop.

          Fade out.
